Post MegaLAN Debriefing 
-------
* What went well:
    + The MegaLAN actually happened and had a decent turnout of participants attending
	+ We sold LOTS of food and drinks throughout the event
	+ Made a grand total of $685.85 from the MegaLAN  (Steph Emailed this Figure)
	+ Tournaments had minimal hiccups and had a generally good reception
	+ Street Fighter guys were very happy with how it went
* What didn't go so well?
	+ Tournament Prizes wasn't the best, we either didn't have any or had no idea how to give, this stems out from the ambiguity of the style of tournament for each of the games played, for the next one we need to refine this
	+ Lack of the consoles for tournaments - We had minimal Xbox's and PS3's, no Wii at all, the old school area went perfectly
	+ Earlier organising and finalising of the timetable, this will ensure people can view the final timetable on the website and sign up as soon as they get to the MegaLAN as opposed to an Ad-Hoc system which was used at this current MegaLAN
	+ Wireless controllers for the consoles had battery issues, including mid-tournament issues; Rectify this by either having a lot of spare batteries on hand or purchasing some charger pack + cable systems for them - apparently not that expensive (Lindsay estimates ~$20)
	+ Tournament Sign-Ups and Pizza ordering was incredibly chaotic
		- This could be rectified by bringing back the LAN management website to allow people to register on the website, then place their Pizza order and sign up for any tournaments they wish to participate in. Either we need to source the old one we used to have or create a new one (possibly a mini-club project)
	+ Way too many games and game varieties had tournaments
		- It becomes a little chaotic when you have 10-12 games with tournaments running and everyone wants to join one, in future we need to limit the number of games to the most popular (possibly a poll in the CASSA forums)
		- Need to lay out the restrictions, rules, and play style for each of the tournaments before hand; Jovin had a bit of experience doing this at this MegaLAN
	+ Used the wrong tape for the cabling on the floor, need to get Gaffa Tape next time
	+ Net dropped a few times throughout the night due to firewall resets (can we avoid this?)
* Ideas on how to improve the next MegaLAN
	+ Contact Blizzard, Valve, DVDCrave, ThinkGeek, MWave.com.au, EB Games, JB Hi Fi, Game, Game Traders, Empire Toys, any others that can be thought of RE: Sponsorships for prizes, equipment etc.
	+ Dinner could be a Sausage Sizzle instead of Pizza as this is more of a money maker for us - it also forces people to go outside and stretch their legs and get some air so they can do more of the face-to-face socializing
	+ The next MegaLAN can have many more participants if we begin advertising early and have prizes on offer.
		- We also have the switch space now (120 ports) however not enough floor space
		- Possible change of venue to the larger rooms in Building 3 Level 2, however will need to check for 3 Phase Power Outlet
	+ Trunking for the switches was a great idea - need to try this again for the next MegaLAN
